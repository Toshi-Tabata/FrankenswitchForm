My project is a submission form for mechanical keyboard switches.



In the community, users can create their own switches and submit them to a google sheet, but they currently are able to submit whatever they want and there is not verification.

What my project aims to do is to solve this problem.



- Login screen with URL
- Submit normal switch
- Searching
- Sends to spreadsheet
- Anonymous login
- Error messages
  - Backend, sql formats and constraints
