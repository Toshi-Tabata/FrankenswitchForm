## TODOs

- Blacklisted combinations retrieved from backend
  - Backend receives the switch combination and checks whether it is blacklisted
  - If it is, fail it when it returns
  - Needs to give which switch parts are failed and why it failed
- Add required modifications (crimping) to certain switch combinations if needed
-
